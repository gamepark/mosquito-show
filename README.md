# How to adapt a game for Game Park!

Welcome, developer! This documentation will guide you if you would like to adapt a board game on Game Park.

First, make sure you have an agreement with us about the game you are going to adapt.

Then, let's code ðŸ™‚

## 1. Git repository
You must install Git on your computer, and create an account on Github if you do not have one.

Then, you need a repository for you game. You can either wait for us to create one, or follow this documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository

## 2. Run the project
Use VSCode, Webstorm or any IDE you like to open the code on you computer.

You must also install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) and Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/)

Now you can install all the dependencies of the project using Yarn. Run this command in the project's folder:
```
yarn install
```
Then you should be able to start the game on your computer:
```
yarn start
```
It should open a browser window on http://localhost:3000 and display the first version of your game!

The project is divided into 2 parts: the rules (/rules), and the application (/app)

The rules describe how the game works.
This code will be used both by Game Park server, and the player's browsers.

The app is how the game is displayed, it will only run in the player's browsers.

## 3. Design the user experience

### Layout the game material

#### The letterbox scale mode

The game must work for computers, tablets and mobile phone.

The easier way is the ["letterbox scale mode"](https://felgo.com/doc/felgo-different-screen-sizes/)

This is already implemented in this file `/app/src/GameDisplay.tsx`: see the "Letterbox" component here.

With this in mind, you can imagine a layout that will display all the game material inside a 16:9 zone,
that will scale from a mobile display up to a computer screen.

Everything must be big enough to read on a mobile phone, or have some way to "zoom-in" later on!

*Feel free to remove the letterbox approach for something else if you think there is something better to do for your game â˜º*

#### Use percentage everywhere
For the content to scale up and down inside the letterbox, you should only use `%` and `em` units in your CSS code.

### Use numbers sparingly
An interface full of numbers can frighten a novice player! Try to use number only when you have no other choice,
or when the player have more than 4 or 5 similar items, for example.

When there is a victory points track, it can be replaced by a number to save some space however!

### Animations
Do not worry too much about the animations: they can be added later on.

One advice though: it is much easier to animate the elements if they all are a direct child of the letterbox component!

## 4. Display the initial state
**Your game always has a state, and the React application always displays the game state.**

The state of the game is a Javascript object. The specifications for this object must be written here: `/rules/src/GameState.ts`

If you change the specification, it will probably break the game setup here: `/rules/src/MyBoardGame.ts`.
In this file, you can rename "MyBoardGame" with the real name of your game, and in the constructor when you have no arguments,
you must set up a new game with the properties matching your specifications.

**Everytime you change GameState, you must open the browser console and run `game.new()` to replace the old obsolete game state with a fresh new game.**

Once you have a satisfying initial game state, you can go back into `/app/src/GameDisplay.tsx` and write components to display the game state the way you want.

## 42. Deploy on Game Park
**First, the rules must be deployed by Game Park (contact us for any new version).**

To deploy the application, first you must configure rclone (https://rclone.org/).

Download rclone, and make it executable (add rclone.exe in the PATH env variable on Windows)

We will provide you with an access_key_id and a secret_access_key (keep it absolutely safe!)

Then, run:

```
rclone config
> n (For "New remote)
name> mosquito-show
Storage> 4 (Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Provider)
provider> Other
env_auth> false
access_key_id> [Enter your access key id here - Never commit that on Git!]
secret_access_key> [Enter you secret access key here - Never commit that on Git!]
region> [Leave empty]
endpoint> cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com
location_constraint> [Leave empty]
acl> public-read
Edit advanced config> n
```

This configuration is only required once.
Now, to deploy a new version of the board game, you have 2 command lines to run:

```
yarn build
rclone sync app/build mosquito-show:mosquito-show.game-park.com --progress --s3-acl=public-read
```
